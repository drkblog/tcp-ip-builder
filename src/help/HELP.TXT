TCP/IP Builder - Reference
==========================

Socket setup:
-------------

Local IP	IP to bind the socket to, has to be one of the IPs of
		your machine.
Local Port	Port of your machine to use, if 0 the first free port
		(over 1024) will be selected. If you are planning to 
		set the socket to Listen you MUST define a port number
		here.
TCP/UDP		Select between TCP and UDP protocol.
Blocking	Reserved.


Create		If TCP was selected, create a socket ready for Connect
		or Listen.
		If UDP was selected, create a socket ready to receive
		and send data. When sending, IP and Port fields in
		Connection Setup section are used as destination
		address.


Connection Setup:
-----------------

IP		Remote IP, the IP of the machine to connect this
		socket.
Port		Remote Port to connect to. (Valid ports are: 1..65535)
Keep alive	Use keep alive. Send packets to keep the connection
		alive.
No delay	Disable the Nagle algorithm. The Nagle algorithm is
		used to reduce the number of small packets sent by a
		host by buffering unacknowledged send data until a
		full-size packet can be sent.

Connect		Connect this client socket to remote address.
Listen		Set this socket to listen for connections (Server).

Send data:
----------

		Type in the data you want to send, then click Send
		button. If you want to add an arbitrary byte just
		type: \<number>	where <number is at most 3 decimal
		digits>
		To insert a back slash character type it twice: \\
		If your number is one or two digits long you will have
		to press space bar to make it appear. If you press any
		other key, the character will appear followed by the
		last key pressed.
		Any character under ASCII 32 will be appended at the
		end of the current content. You may use copy & paste
		functions to move characters under 32 if you need.

Button 'X'	Clear send data edit box.
Don't route	Don't route the packet, send right to the interface.
Out of band	Send packet in out-of-band data connection. (TCP Only)
Parse ASCII	Will parse any string in the format 0x<n> (where n is
		a two hexadecimal digits number) -In example 0x35 will
		be translate into ASCII(35h) => '5'

Receive data:
-------------

		NOTE: Binary data received will be displayed as long as
		the operating system configuration allows each specific
		character. To get a full view of incoming data use '>'
		Any NULL character received will show as '\0' in the
		Edit box control.

Button 'X'	Clear receive data edit box and Packet information.
Button '>'	Open RAW Packet Data window to analize received
		packets. Default Append mode on, which appends incoming
		data to this window. Mark boundaries option will mark
		end of every appended packet with a pipe '|'
Button 'D'	Turn on debug mode to know address and port of
		incoming data over an UDP socket.
